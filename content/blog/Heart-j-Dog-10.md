Finding the Heart today in my reading makes me think of the directions I am taking to be more mindful about myself. Supplemented with the Dog, it seems like it should be something I become loyal and devoted to.

Right now, my goals are to keep myself calm before I sleep, and waking up with some peace of mind. When I sleep, I forget about my very being: who I am, and where I'm heading to. It becomes a separate place in my brain; a prison.

When I do get up, it is easy to drift into a mind-numbingly pointless web-surfing, just absorbing small shots of dopamine whenever I scroll through a post instead of leaving my bed. I want to replace that with 5 minutes of _doing absolutely nothing at all._
