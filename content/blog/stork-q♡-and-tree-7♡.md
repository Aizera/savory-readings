Discovering the Stork today makes me think about a yearning for transition, mainly for my daily life aspects. It doesn't have to be a massive change, but rather a small change that comes a long way. Combined with the tree, it may represent a change that can make me grow as a person. As it takes time for a tree to grow with the right conditions, I need to be patient to see a true change in myself. After all, habits cannot be turned overnight. Personally, I want to try getting out of bed a little earlier, reading a couple more pages of a book in a day, and meditating for a few minutes. A positive change.
