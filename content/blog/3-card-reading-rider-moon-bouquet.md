It's been a while since I've last written; I've forgotten how relaxing it is to take a moment and let the cards take me to another world. Under the moonlight is where our subconscious lie, rider and bouquet signifying the presence of an upcoming introduction of positivity. Recently I've left all form of hope buried into the abyss of my mind; I hope I can finally declutter the mind to discover it once more.
