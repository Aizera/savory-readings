Today, I woke up feeling pretty good, except for anything but studying. I decided to ask a more specific question. A 3 card reading is meant to formulate a more streamlined insight to the situation at hand.

Q: How should I be approaching my studies?

A: The main subject,in the spread, the dog, says: a companion is probably the answer. The mountain and book paired shows that they may also be facing similar struggles in the quest for knowledge and learning. To overcome the obstacles faced in learning, it's a good idea to work as a team.
