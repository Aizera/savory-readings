Animus (Man), a card that is designed to be the center of any reading along with Anima (woman), is a card I personally find to interpret in a pair reading. If the reader is not male, Animus can represent a male friend, family, or any male companion. Paired with The Anchor, it can either be directed towards someone I know who is being resilient, or it may be the stability or the strength of masculinity within oneself. The Anchor can be interpreted in both a positive and negative light, perhaps stability might equate to security and comfort, but on the flip-side, it might also point to the inability to let go of certain things: perhaps it can be a feeling from the past that haunts me and weighs down my mind. It depends on how well the reading connects with current life happenings.
