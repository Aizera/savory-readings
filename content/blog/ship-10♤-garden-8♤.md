My mind turned out to be surprisingly quiet today after a swift end of a five hour sleep. Today it neither demanded or begged to stay in the comfort zone of my bed. Beginning the day like clockwork, I can feel myself traversing towards a more accepting state of mind; the ship representing a steady path, the garden signaling my gradual opening of myself to others, finding comfort in my surroundings, regardless of whether the support is concrete.
