\~Challenge of Suffering

The subject card is a mountain, you should be wary of something that challenges you, something that you have to climb to the top to declare that you've conquered it. You're presented with it, you must face it.

The Modifier card tells a bit more of what the subject card is about. What kind of challenge? Perhaps it is a challenge that comes from losing what you had before. Which may be a person or a feeling. Did you lose contact with someone close to you, or did you drift away from something that used to be your biggest passion? It is an indicator that you are in dire need of conquering your sorrows instead of drowning in them. Regain your motivations, do not lose hope.
