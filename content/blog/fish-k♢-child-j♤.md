![Fish and Child cards](/images/Screenshot_20191010-141233_Seventh Sphere Lenormand.jpg)

Not sure how to interpret this one because the fish card usually represents finances, being paired with child may mean that I maybe have trouble spending my money wisely due to inexperience in handling money. Out of all the readings so far this is one of the ones I can't find a direct relation to my daily life as I seldom spend money on a day to day basis. However, there are some things I was talking about today that I do wish to splurge on, even if it may not be the smartest decision.
