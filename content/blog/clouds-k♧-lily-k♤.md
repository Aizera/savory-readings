It hasn't been very long since I've last seen clouds in my reading (Clouds/Ring). Unlike the previous reading of doubts within promises which is an external conflict, combining cloud and lily reflects the disarray in our mind, questioning our comfort and sense of enjoyment. "You can't seem to find what brings you satisfaction", they say in quite the straight-forward and provoking manner.
