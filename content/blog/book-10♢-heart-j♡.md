Lately, I've been reading a couple of personal development books, and the gist of them is that you gain a compound interest from small things you do everyday. Things that are easy to do, are just as easy not to do. One minute of meditation a day: it's so easy to do it. But it's also very easy to just _not._ That is the obstacle.

From reading these, I wish to follow through with what I've learned. I am wading through these pages slowly, reading a few every day. I've also been meditating, in a sense it's calming for the moment but I don't see the difference yet. But I want to keep doing it.
