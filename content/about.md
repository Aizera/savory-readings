This blog is something small I made to reflect on myself, as well as improve and maintain motivation for my writing. I don't think Tarot or Lenormand readings can predict the future, but it can serve as a catalyst to find the present in a particular frame of mind. As someone who spends their life through the eyes of science, this may bring forth a mental contrast of open interpretation to signs.

I am using the [Seventh Sphere Lenormand App](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seventh.sphere.app), and using the reading technique from the provided [tutorial](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/learn-tarot-with-labyrinthos-academy/how-to-read-lenormand-card-combinations).
